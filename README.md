## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/anita86/404-NOT-FOUND/blob/main/pesta%C3%B1a%20pc.png)

This is a desktop and responsive landing page for a 404 Server error.
Yo can see it here: https://anita86.github.io/404-NOT-FOUND/   
Front end is not my favorite, and I don't love CSS, but I'm trying to improve my skills in this area.

Hope you like it, and comments or sugestions are accepted :)
